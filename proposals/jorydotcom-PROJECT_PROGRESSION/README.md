# Project Progression Proposal
>  Stage 0

## Champion

## Description

The [PROJECT_PROGRESSION.md][] document describes the process and criteria for any project to join the foundation and 'graduate' to a 'Top Level Project.' This proposal incorporates ideas from the CNCF, the JSF, and the [Community Drafting Doc](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qUcvZz4wmQtwcWu9rWjxFNmWw5plD9-4_7mtvQvCegk/edit#slide=id.g45c3106792_4_115).

Note that this document will utilize the naming conventions that are to be determined in [#44](https://github.com/nodejs/bootstrap/issues/44#issuecomment-440026298). 

## Required Resources

Approval of the bootstrap team.

## Who would be responsible?

In the merged organization, the CPC would be responsible for shepherding this process. In the interim, I believe the Bootstrap team and respective boards.

## Why this proposal is important

Existing projects need to know what their "status" will be in the new organization. Potential projects need to know what the criteria and requirements are of Foundation projects. 

## What is neccessary to get this proposal to stage 2

There are several sections that need to see further refinement/consensus building. There are also open issues which affect the language in this document. This includes: 

* Whether there is an Open Governance requirement of Top Level Projects
* Defined Project Proposal Requirements, & explicit metrics for how to validate that those requirements have been met.
* Clarification of Stage Definitions and Monikers (see also #44)
  * do we require projects to keep public lists of orgs using their technology
* Confirmation that the CPC will be responsible for project acceptance process
* Clarification on what resources a Archived/Emeritus project will have/need
* Language for the Proposed Annual Review Process
