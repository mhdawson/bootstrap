## I. Overview
This governance policy describes how an open source project can formally join the Foundation via the [Project Proposal Process](). It describes the [Stages]() a project may be admitted under and what the criteria and expectations are for a given stage, as well as the acceptance criteria for a project to move from one stage to another. It also describes the [Annual Review Process]() through which those changes will be evaluated and made. 

Project progression - movement from one stage to another - allows projects to particpate at the level that is most appropriate for them given where they are in their lifecycle. Regardless of stage, all _$FOUNDATION_ projects benefit from a deepened alignment with existing projects, and access to mentorship, support, and foundation resources such as the travel fund.

For more information about how your project can benefit from Foundation membership and services, please see [TBD Document]().

This proposal has been modified from the [CNCF process documentation](https://github.com/cncf/toc/tree/master/process).

## II. Project Proposal Process

### Introduction
This governance policy sets forth the proposal process for projects to be accepted into the _$FOUNDATION_. The process is the same for both existing projects which seek to move into the _$FOUNDATION_, and new projects to be formed within the _$FOUNDATION_.

### Project Proposal Requirements
Projects must be proposed via GitHub. Project proposals submitted to the _$FOUNDATION_ must provide the following information to the best of their ability:

* name of project
* project description (what it does, why it is valuable, origin and history)
* statement on alignment with _$FOUNDATION_ charter mission
* link to current Code of Conduct
* sponsor from CPC (sponsor helps mentor projects)
* preferred maturity level 
* license 
* source control (GitHub by default)
* external dependencies (including licenses)
* initial committers (how long working on project)
* infrastructure requests 
* communication channels (slack, irc, mailing lists)
* issue tracker (GitHub by default)
* website 
* release methodology and mechanics
* social media accounts
* community size and any existing financial sponsorship

### Project Acceptance Process
* Projects are required to present their proposal at a CPC meeting
* Projects get accepted via a 2/3 supermajority vote of the CPC

## III. Stages - Definitions & Expectations
Every _$FOUNDATION_ project has an associated maturity level. Proposed _$FOUNDATION_ projects should state their preferred maturity level. Projects of all maturities have access to _$FOUNDATION_ resources.

*note: all stage names are tbd pending outcome of [#44](https://github.com/nodejs/bootstrap/issues/44#issuecomment-440026298)*

### Sandbox Stage
**Definition** 
Sandbox Stage projects are projects which the CPC believes are, or have the potential to be, important to the ecosystem of Top-Level Projects or the JS ecosystem as a whole. They may be early-stage projects just getting started, or they may be long-established projects with minimal resource needs. The Sandbox Stage provides a beneficial, neutral home for these projects in order to foster collaborative development and provide a path to deeper alignment with other _$FOUNDATION_ projects via the graduation process.

**Examples**
1. New projects that are designed to extend one or more _$FOUNDATION_ projects with functionality or interoperability libraries. 
1. Independent projects that fit the _$FOUNDATION_ mission and provide potential for a novel approach to existing functional areas (or are an attempt to meet an unfulfilled need).
1. Projects commissioned or sanctioned by the _$FOUNDATION_.
1. Any project that realistically intends to join the _$FOUNDATION_ Incubation or Top Level Stages in the future and wishes to lay the foundations for that transition.

**Expectations**
End users should evaluate Sandbox projects with care - some Sandbox projects may fail, and others may stay in the  Sandbox Stage indefinitely. Sandbox stage projects will receive minimal marketing support from the _$FOUNDATION_. Sandbox Stage projects will be reviewed on an annual basis; they may also request a status review by submitting a report to the CPC.

**Acceptance Criteria**
To be considered for Sandbox Stage, the project must meet the following requirements:
* 2 CPC sponsors to champion the project & provide mentorship
* A presentation to at the meeting of the CPC
* Adherence to the _$FOUNDATION_ IP Policy
* Upon acceptance, Sandbox projects must list their status prominently on website/readme

### Incubating Stage*
**Definition** 
The Incubation Stage is for projects that are interested in reaching the Top-Level Stage, or want to have more access, participation, responsibilities and representation in the CPC. Incubating projects will receive mentorship from the CPC and are expected to actively develop their community of contributors, governance, and other project documentation.

In order to support their active development, projects in the incubation stage have a higher level of access to marketing and other resources which will be agreed upon acceptance to the incubation stage and reviewed/agreed on a yearly basis. Progress will be reviewed on a yearly basis and a project may be asked by the CPC to move back to the Sandbox stage if the level of development drops off or stalls. 

**Examples**
1. Projects that are on their way or very likely to become Top Level Projects.

**Expectations**
Projects can remain in the Incubating stage indefinitely, but they are generally expected to graduate within two years.

**Acceptance Criteria**
To be considered for Incubation Stage, the project must meet the Sandbox requirements as well as the following:
 * Document that it is being used successfully in production by at least three independent end users which, in the CPCâ€™s judgement, are of adequate quality and scope.
 * Have a healthy number of committers. A committer is defined as someone with the commit bit; i.e., someone who can accept contributions to some or all of the project.
 * Demonstrate a substantial ongoing flow of commits and merged contributions.
 * Since these metrics can vary significantly depending on the type, scope and size of a project, the CPC has final judgement over the level of activity that is adequate to meet these criteria.
 * Receive a two-thirds supermajority vote of the CPC to move to Incubation Stage. 

### Top Level/Graduate Stage*
**Definition**

**Examples**

**Expectations**

**Acceptance Criteria**
To graduate from Sandbox or Incubating status, or for a new project to join as a Top-Level project, a project must meet the Incubating stage criteria plus:

 * Have committers from at least two organizations.
 * Adopt the _$FOUNDATION_ Code of Conduct.
 * Explicitly define a project governance and committer process. This preferably is laid out in a GOVERNANCE.md file and references an OWNERS.md file showing the current and emeritus committers.
 * Have a public list of project adopters for at least the primary repo (e.g., ADOPTERS.md or logos on the project website).
 * Receive a supermajority vote from the CPC to move to Graduation stage. Projects can attempt to move directly from Sandbox to Top Level, if they can demonstrate sufficient maturity. 


### Archive/Emeritus Stage*
**Definition**

**Examples**

**Expectations**
Projects in this stage are not in active development. The foundation will continue to hold the IP and any trademarks and domains, but the project does not draw on foundation resources. 

**Acceptance Criteria**
Archiving criteria: projects may be archived via a 2/3 vote from the CPC and with approval from project ownership." In cases where there is a lack of project ownership, only a 2/3 vote from the CPC is required
