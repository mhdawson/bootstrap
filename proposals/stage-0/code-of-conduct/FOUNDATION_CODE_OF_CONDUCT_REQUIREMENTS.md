# Foundation Code of Conduct Requirements

It is important that there be a Code of Conduct (CoC) which
is documented and enforced for the _$FOUNDATION_ and the
projects within it. This document defines the requirements
for a CoC for the _$FOUNDATION_ and the projects which are part
of the foundation.


## Code of Conduct

The _$FOUNDATION_ has adopted the
[Contributor Covenant v1.4.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.md)
as its code of conduct and it applies to all activities/spaces at the foundation level. In
addition, projects joining the foundation are required to adopt this code of conduct
within 3 months of joining the foundation.

The foundation has chosen to require a common Code of Conduct to maximize its effectiveness
with which it can support Projects in their efforts to apply the Code of Conduct as well as
an effective escalation process. 

## Enforcement

For spaces managed by the foundation complaints can be forwarded to report@xxxx.org and will
be investigated by the CPC or its delegates. All complaints will be reviewed, 
investigated, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate
to the circumstances. The CPC is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard
to the reporter of an incident.

For spaces managed by each project, the project must provide a email to which complaints 
can be forwarded and document that complaints will be investigated and will result in a
response that is deemed appropriate for the circumstances. Each project is free to
implement enforcement of the Code of Conduct using processes appropriate for the size
and scope of the project including any day-to-day moderation of the project spaces. As part
of these processes, however, the project must agree to:
  * maintain the confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an indicent
  * to participate in and document the path for escalation as outlined in the section on Escalation.

## Escalation

It is expected that most reports will be handled successfully by the CPC (in the
case of reports relating fo spaces within the scope of the foundation) or
the processes put in place by a project. In exceptional cases were a
reporter wishes to challenge the response from the CPC or Project, or does
not feel comfortable reporting through the standard proceses, an escalation
report can be made to coc-escalation@xxx.org.

All escalations will be reviewed and investigated by the Code of Conduct Panel (CoCP)
and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
The Code of Conduct panel is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard
to the reporter of an escalation. 

### Code of Conduct panel

The Code of Conduct panel is a cross-foundation team who have been trained in moderation
and code of conduct issues. The makeup of this team is as follows:

* The Foundation Executive director
* 1 member from the Board
* 1 member from the CPC
* each top-level project may optionally provide 1 member
* the non top-level projects may optionally provide 1 member
* optionally 1 invited outside expert as agreed by the other CoCP members.

Members of the CoCP team will be added for a 1-year team and will be re-confirmed on
a yearly basis.

## Resources

The CPC will establish a sub-team which will build a set of resources/processes that
can be re-used by projects when implementing their CoC processes and enforcement.
