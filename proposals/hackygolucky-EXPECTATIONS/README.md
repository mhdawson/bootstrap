>  Stage 1

## Champion

Tracy Hinds (@hackygolucky)

## Description

This [EXPECTATIONS.md][] document is an outline of expectations from the projects of the Node.js and JS Foundations to communicate priorities that should be considered and converted into language for the Bylaws of the proposed merged foundation, where the scope of the Boards and projects overlapâ€“in order to provide an outline and structure for the foundation attuned to the needs of the projects and ecosystem stakeholders who have participated.

## Required Resources

Approval of the bootstrap team and collaboration with Directors of the Boards on each foundation.

## Who would be responsible?

The bootstrap committee to finalize for consideration of the Boards and Legal.

## Why this proposal is important

The needs of the projects and ecosystem stakeholders being voiced through the governance of the foundation for which they are represented is vital for the foundation to succeed.

## What is neccessary to get this proposal to stage 2

For this proposal to move to stage 2 we will need consensus that the text in [EXPECTATIONS.md](./EXPECTATIONS.md) is as holistic of requirements that we can muster that would need to be included in Bylaws for the project members and ecosystem stakeholders to feel confident to move ahead in the merger process. 

## What is neccessary to get this proposal to stage 3

The Boards and Legal would review this proposal and Legal would then draft the expectations as language that would be folded into the Bylaws to be developed for the proposed foundation.

### Unresolved Questions
- subject of membership to projects, not just the foundation overall
- c3 structure(there has been a question now of whether c3 board representation is necessary depending on what the c3 flushes out to be)
- Node.js having a Board seat
