# Cross Project Council (CPC) Charter

## Section 1. Guiding Principle.

The _$FOUNDATION_ Foundation will operate transparently, openly,
collaboratively, and ethically. Project proposals, timelines, and status
must not merely be open, but also easily visible to outsiders.

## Section 2. Evolution of _$FOUNDATION_ Foundation Governance.

Most large, complex open source communities have both a business and a
technical governance model. _$FOUNDATION_ Foundation’s technical leadership
is the Cross Project Council (“CPC”). _$FOUNDATION_ Foundation’s business
leadership is the Board of Directors (the “Board”).

This Cross Project Council Charter reflects a carefully
constructed balanced role for the CPC and the Board in the governance of
_$FOUNDATION_ Foundation. The charter amendment process is for the
_$FOUNDATION_ to propose changes using simple majority of the
full _$FOUNDATION_, the proposed changes being subject to review
and approval by the Board. The Board may additionally make amendments to
the _$FOUNDATION_ charter at any time, though the Board will not interfere
with day-to-day discussions, votes or meetings
of the CPC.

## Section 3. Board’s Role in Setting _$FOUNDATION_ Foundation’s Strategic Direction. 

The Board will set the overall CPC Policy. The policy will describe the
overarching scope of the _$FOUNDATION_ Foundation initiative, _$FOUNDATION_ 
Foundation’s technical vision and direction and project release
expectations in the form of expected cadence and intent. The Board will
use the CPC as a delegate body for governing technical implementation,
individual project scope and direction while they remain within the scope
and direction of the policies as described in the CPC Policy document and
approved by the Board.

The Board sets the overall CPC policy through [Foundation mission and vision
statements][] as well as within the [Foundation bylaws][]. The policy describes
the overarching scope of the _$FOUNDATION_ initiatives , technical vision,
and direction. The Board uses the CPC as a delegate body for governing
high-level technical policy and procedures while remaining within the scope and
direction of the policies set by the Board.


## Section 4. Establishment of the CPC.

The CPC is in inclusive group with 2 types of members:

* Regular members
* Voting members

**Regular members** Regular members have the roles and responsibilities
as outlined below. In any case where it is not specified that a role
or responsibility applies to a Voting member, then a Regular member is
implied. Anyone who has been a member of one of the projects under the 
Foundation for at least 3 months may request to
become a regular member by opening a PR to add themselves to the list of
regular members. Regular members remain for as long as they are active
within the work of the CPC. Regular members who have not been active
in GitHub, participated in meetings, or other work of the CPC for 3 months may be
removed from the list of Regular members. In addition, a Regular CPC member
can be removed by voluntary resignation, or by a standard CPC motion.

**Voting members** Voting members have the roles and responsibilities
as outlined below. Voting members are selected as follows:

* Each top level project may nominate 2 member through a process
of their choosing. Once nominated the member must be ratified by the
board before becoming a Voting member.

* 2 Voting members may be nominated by the non top-level projects.
If a vote is required among candidates nominated by different projects,
each of the non-top level projects will have 2 votes (one for each position).

* 2 Voting members may be nominated by the Regular members. Once
nominated these members must be ratified by the board before
becoming a Voting member.

Voting members are expected to make a time commitment that
allows them to be responsive to CPC business, participate regularly
in meetings and to participate in all voting matters.  They are
also expected to help to "enable" work of the regular CPC
members by providing leadership, help with interactions with the
board and Foundation staff and to generally help grease the
wheels to keep things moving.

Voting members serve for a term of 1 year and must be re-nominated
and ratified by the board each year. In addition, a Voting CPC member
can be removed by by voluntary resignation, by a standard CPC motion,
or in accordance to the participation rules described for Regular
members.
 
Changes to CPC membership should be posted in the agenda, and may be suggested
as any other agenda item.

No more than one-fourth of the Voting CPC members may be affiliated with the
same employer. If removal or resignation of a Voting CPC member, or a change of
employment by a Voting CPC member, creates a situation where more than
one-fourth of the Voting CPC membership shares an employer, then the situation
must be immediately remedied by the resignation or removal of one or more
PC

The CPC may, at its discretion, invite any number of non-voting observers to
participate in the public portion of CPC discussions and meetings.

The CPC shall meet regularly using tools that enable participation by the
community. The meeting shall be directed by the CPC Chairperson.
Responsibility for directing individual meetings may be
delegated by the CPC Chairperson to any other CPC member. The CPC chairperson
shall be one of the Voting members, and will be selected by the CPC members
through consensus or if necessary a vote as described in the section titled "Voting".
Minutes or an appropriate recording shall be taken and made available to
the community through accessible public postings.

Section 5. Responsibilities and Expectations of the CPC

Subject to such policies as may be set by the Board, the CPC is responsible for
ensuring: 

   * ensuring collaboration is the driving principle within a Project, between
     _$FOUNDATION_ Projects, and between _$FOUNDATION_ Projects and the broader
     community.
   * defining and maintaining neutral consensus for the technical vision for the _$FOUNDATION_
   * creating conceptual architecture for how the projects fit together.
   * Voting members are responsible for approving new projects within the scope
     for _$FOUNDATION_ set by the Governing Board, as outlined in [XXXX].
   * Voting members are responsible for making final decisions on aligning projects,
     removing or archiving projects, as outlined in [XXXX].
   * Voting members are responsible for approving funds for budgets delegated 
     to the project. A good example is the travel fund.
   * follow and be up to date on Board/$FOUNDATION initiatives and communicate them to the projects.
   * defining common practices to be implemented across _$FOUNDATION_ projects, if any.
   * The CPC is also responsible for mediating technical conflicts between
     _$FOUNDATION_ Projects when attempts to resolve those conflicts within the Project
   were unsuccessful. 
   * Creating a yearly budget that can be drawn on by the projects.
   * The CPC serves as the _$FOUNDATION_'s primary technical
     liaison body with external open source projects, consortiums and groups and is
     also responsible for ensuring that the _$FOUNDATION_ has appropriate technical
     participation in standards bodies by finding an encouraging projects members to
     particiapte in these bodies.
   * Managing the Individual membership program
   * Managing programs to improve Inclusivity and Diversity
   * Guiding projects into appropriate Foundation paths
   * Shared resources, tooling and funding for projects and Commons.js (Events
     Collabl Summit, Travel fund)
   * Code of Conduct incident response support
   * Developing a framework for community end-user feedback
   * Managing programs to offer mentorship to external individuals
   * Managing developer outreach programs
   * Support project advocacy and recognition programs
   * Identify, recruit and engage prospective projects
   * Voting members are responsible for making a final decision if consensus
     cannot be reached among members.
   * Members of the CPC, or committees consisting of subsets of the CPC
     membership will be expected to meet on a regular basis to discuss topics
     such as new project acceptance into the mentorship program, project graduation
     from the mentorship program, Project issues and conflicts, opportunities
     for collaboration between Projects, opportunities for the Foundation in the
     greater JavaScript community, etc.
   * When needed, members of the CPC will be expected to create subcommittees
     or working groups to make proposals, delegate areas of responsibility and
     to make decisions on significant topics. Delegation to the subcommittee
     will be through a written set of responsibilities for the subcomittee or group.
     
     
## Section 6. Non-Responsibilities of the CPC

_$FOUNDATION_ Projects are self-governing entities. All policies and procedures for interacting with, contributing to and making decisions within a Project are defined, implemented, and documented by that Project’s maintainers and community during the mentorship process. Specific technical decisions within a Project will be the responsibility of the Project and establishment and implementation of the decision making process will be done within the guidelines as defined by CPC charter. Those Project decisions and responsibilities include but are not limited to:

* Setting release dates.
* Release quality standards.
* Technical direction.
* Project governance and process.
* GitHub repository hosting.
* Conduct guidelines.
* Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators.
* Development process and any coding standards.
* Mediating technical conflicts between Collaborators.


Not withstanding the above, the Projects and the entire technical community will follow any processes
as may be specified by the Board relating to the intake and license compliance review of contributions,
including the _$FOUNDATION_ IP Policy.

## Section 7. Elections

Leadership roles in _$FOUNDATION_ Foundation will be peer elected
representatives of the community.

For election of persons (such as the CPC Chairperson), a multiple-candidate
method should be used, such as:

* [Condorcet][] or
* [Single Transferable Vote][]

Multiple-candidate methods may be reduced to simple election by plurality
when there are only two candidates for one position to be filled. No
election is required if there is only one candidate and no objections to
the candidates election. Elections shall be done within the Projects by
the Collaborators active in the Project.


The CPC will elect from amongst voting CPC members a CPC Chairperson to
work on building an agenda for CPC meetings and a CPC Director to represent
the CPC to the Board for a term of one year according to the _$FOUNDATION_ Foundation’s
By-laws. The Chair and Director may be (but are not required to be)
the same person. The CPC shall hold annual elections to select a CPC
Chairperson and Director; there are no limits on the number of terms a
CPC Chairperson or Director may serve.

## Section 8. Decision Making

For internal Project decisions, Collaborators shall operate under Lazy
Consensus. The CPC follows a [Consensus Seeking][] decision making model. When
an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator will ask "Does
anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a CPC member can call for either a
closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next meeting. Votes shall
follow the procedure described in the [Voting][] section of this charter.

## Section 9. Voting

The CPC follows a [Consensus Seeking][] decision making model. When an agenda
item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator will ask "Does anyone
object?" as a final call for dissent from the consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a CPC member can call for
either a closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next meeting.
The call for a vote must be seconded by a majority of the CPC or else the
discussion will continue.

For all votes, a simple majority of all Voting CPC members for, or against, the issue
wins. A Voting CPC member may choose to participate in any vote through abstention.

Note that, in addition to requiring a simple majority vote of the CPC Voting
CPC members, all changes to this charter are also subject to approval
from the _$FOUNDATION_ Foundation board.

## Section 10. Definitions

encumbered by the TAC or Board.

**Collaborator**: a Contributor within a Project that has made significant and
valuable contributions and has been given commit-access to that Project
repository.
