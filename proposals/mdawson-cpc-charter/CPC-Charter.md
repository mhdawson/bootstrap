# Cross Project Council (CPC) Charter

## Section 1. Guiding Principle.

The _$FOUNDATION_ Foundation will operate transparently, openly,
collaboratively, and ethically. Project proposals, timelines, and status
must not merely be open, but also easily visible to outsiders.

## Section 2. Evolution of _$FOUNDATION_ Foundation Governance.

Most large, complex open source communities have both a business and a
technical governance model. _$FOUNDATION_ Foundation’s technical leadership
is the Cross Project Council (“CPC”). _$FOUNDATION_ Foundation’s business
leadership is the Board of Directors (the “Board”).

This Cross Project Council Charter reflects a carefully
constructed balanced role for the CPC and the Board in the governance of
_$FOUNDATION_ Foundation. The charter amendment process is for the
_$FOUNDATION_ to propose changes using simple majority of the
full _$FOUNDATION_, the proposed changes being subject to review
and approval by the Board. The Board may additionally make amendments to
the _$FOUNDATION_ charter at any time, though the Board will not interfere
with day-to-day discussions, votes or meetings
of the CPC.

## Section 3. Board’s Role in Setting _$FOUNDATION_ Foundation’s Strategic Direction. 

The Board will set the overall CPC Policy. The policy will describe the
overarching scope of the _$FOUNDATION_ Foundation initiative, _$FOUNDATION_ 
Foundation’s technical vision and direction and project release
expectations in the form of expected cadence and intent. The Board will
use the CPC as a delegate body for governing technical implementation,
individual project scope and direction while they remain within the scope
and direction of the policies as described in the CPC Policy document and
approved by the Board.

The Board sets the overall CPC policy through [Foundation mission and vision
statements][] as well as within the [Foundation bylaws][]. The policy describes
the overarching scope of the _$FOUNDATION_ initiatives , technical vision,
and direction. The Board uses the CPC as a delegate body for governing
high-level technical policy and procedures while remaining within the scope and
direction of the policies set by the Board.


## Section 4. Establishment of the CPC.

\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> Node.js

CPC memberships are not time-limited. There is no maximum size of the CPC.
The size is expected to vary in order to ensure adequate coverage of important
areas of expertise, balanced with the ability to make decisions efficiently.
The CPC must have at least three members.

There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for CPC
membership beyond these rules. The CPC may add additional members to the
CPC by a standard CPC motion and vote. A CPC member may be removed from the
CPC by voluntary resignation, by a standard CPC motion, or in accordance to the
participation rules described below.

\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> JS Foundation

TAC memberships are time-limited to 1 year terms with no limit on the number of
terms a member may serve. The TAC will be limited to 25 voting seats and
membership of the TAC will consist of:

1. One representative from each JS Foundation Platinum Member organization.
2. One representative from the Node.js Foundation. See the [Ecosystem
Mentorship][] section below for details concerning the relationship between the
JS Foundation and the Node.js Foundation.
3. Individuals from the greater JS community as appointed by the existing TAC
and the Board. This includes JS Foundation Project representatives as nominated
by Projects that have completed and graduated from the mentorship process.

There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for TAC membership
beyond these rules. The TAC and the Board may add additional members from the JS
community to the TAC by  following the election process as described in the
[Elections][] section of this charter. A TAC member, including those appointed
by Projects and Member organizations may be removed from the TAC by voluntary
resignation, or by a standard TAC motion and vote. If the removed member is a
Project or Member organization representative, that Project or Member
organization may appoint a new representative. The removed member may again be
considered for addition to the TAC after a term of 1 year from their removal. At
the end of a member's term, that term may be renewed for an additional term by a
standard TAC motion and vote.

Multiple-candidate methods may be reduced to simple election by plurality
when there are only two candidates for one position to be filled. No
election is required if there is only one candidate and no objections to
the candidates election. Elections shall be done within the Projects by
the Collaborators active in the Project.


\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> Node.js
The CPC will elect from amongst voting CPC members a CPC Chairperson to
work on building an agenda for CPC meetings and a CPC Director to represent
the CPC to the Board for a term of one year according to the _$FOUNDATION_ Foundation’s

the same person. The CPC shall hold annual elections to select a CPC
Chairperson and Director; there are no limits on the number of terms a
CPC Chairperson or Director may serve.

\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> JS Foundation
Each Project that has graduated from the mentorship program may nominate a representative to be appointed to the CPC. Elections shall be done within the Projects by the Collaborators active in the Project.

Foundation supporting Member organizations may elect representatives to the CPC and may use whatever means they deem fit to determine the individuals who will fill those roles in accordance with the limits set forth in the Establishment of the CPC section above.

====================

## Section 7. Decision Making

For internal Project decisions, Collaborators shall operate under Lazy
Consensus. The CPC follows a [Consensus Seeking][] decision making model. When
an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator will ask "Does
anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a CPC member can call for either a
closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next meeting. Votes shall
follow the procedure described in the [Voting][] section of this charter.

## Section 8. Voting

The CPC follows a [Consensus Seeking][] decision making model. When an agenda
item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator will ask "Does anyone
object?" as a final call for dissent from the consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a CPC member can call for
either a closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next meeting.
The call for a vote must be seconded by a majority of the CPC or else the
discussion will continue.

For all votes, a simple majority of all CPC members for, or against, the issue
wins. A CPC member may choose to participate in any vote through abstention.

Note that, in addition to requiring a simple majority vote of the CPC, all
changes to this charter are also subject to approval from the _$FOUNDATION_
Foundation board.
