## Description

This document captures a proposed charter for the CPC
(or equivalent) using the Node.js TSC, JSF TAC and
CNCF TOC charters as a starting points.

## Required Resources

Discussion/approval by bootstrap committee

## Who would be responsible?

In current proposals for the groups within a merged
foundation, the CPC would be responsible for defining
and updating its charter.

## How would success be measured?

Success is approval of the document as the Charter for
the CPC or its use as the basis for the document that
captures the charter for the CPC (or equivalent) in the
merged foundation.

## Why this proposal is important

We need to better understand the charter for the CPC
to validate the structure being proposed for the merged
foundation.

## What is neccessary to complete this proposal

* Agreement on the number of board members the CPC should
  have.
