## Description

This [GOVERNANCE.md][] document is a basic outline of the governance model for the bootstrap team. It outline how membership is defined and how we will collaborate.

## Required Resources

Approval of the bootstrap team.

The bootstrap committee

## Why this proposal is important

We need basic governance to operate

## What is neccessary to get this proposal to stage 3

As this proposal does not need to be approved by either board and doesn't have any budgetary or legal requriements I believe
that we can move immediately from Stage 2 to Stage 3 at the same time.
