# OpenJS Cross Project Council

For the current list of Team members, see the project
[README.md](./README.md).

## Members

The [openjs-foundation/cross-project-council](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council) GitHub
repository is maintained by the Team and additional Members who are
added on an ongoing basis.

## Team Membership

Team Membership is not time-limited. There is no fixed size of the Team.

There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for Team Membership beyond these rules.

The following groups automatically have membership and can request to be added to the github team:

* OpenJS Foundation Voting Members
* OpenJS Foundation Regular Members
* OpenJS Foundation Board of Directors
* OpenJS Foundation Project Maintainers

## Team Meetings

The Team meets weekly on Zoom.us. A designated moderator
approved by the Team runs the meeting. Each meeting should be
published to YouTube.

Items are added to the Team agenda that are considered contentious or
are modifications of governance, contribution policy, Team membership,
or release process.

The intention of the agenda is not to approve or review all patches;
that should happen continuously on GitHub and be handled by the larger
group of Collaborators.

Any community member or contributor can ask that something be added to
the next meeting's agenda by logging a GitHub Issue. Any Collaborator,
Team member or the moderator can add the item to the agenda by adding
the ***cross-project-council-agenda*** tag to the issue.

Prior to each Team meeting the moderator will share the agenda with
members of the Team. Team members can add any items they like to the
agenda at the beginning of each meeting. The moderator and the Team
cannot veto or remove items.

The moderator is responsible for summarizing the discussion of each
agenda item and sends it as a pull request after the meeting.

## Consensus Seeking Process

The Team follows a
[Consensus Seeking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making)
decision-making model.

When an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus, the moderator
will ask "Does anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the
consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus, a Team member can call for
the item to be decided by a vote or to table the issue to the next
meeting. In both cases the decision must be seconded by a majority of the Team
or else the discussion will continue. Simple majority wins. Only Active
Members participate in a vote.

## Aproving Project Charters

Per the [CPC charter section 5](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/master/CPC-CHARTER.md#section-5-responsibilities-and-expectations-of-the-cpc), the voting CPC members are responsible for approving project
charters and changes to them as per section
[5](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/master/CPC-CHARTER.md#section-5-responsibilities-and-expectations-of-the-cpc).

Approval of the initial charter or changes to an existing charter will
be approved by opening an issue requesting approvle in the cross-project-council
[repository](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/)

The request will be approved through our standard concensus seeking process with the following
conditions:

* there are no outstanding objections
* there are two or more approvals by voting CPC members
* the board has been consulted in the case of substantive changes
* The PR has been open for at least 14 days

Pull requests that change governance of the CPC must meet the following conditions
