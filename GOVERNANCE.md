# OpenJS Cross Project Council

For the current list of Team members, see the project
[README.md](./README.md).

## Members

The [openjs-foundation/cross-project-council](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council) GitHub
repository is maintained by the Team and additional Members who are
added on an ongoing basis.

## Team Membership

Team Membership is not time-limited. There is no fixed size of the Team.

There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for Team Membership beyond these rules.

The following groups automatically have membership and can request to be added to the github team:

* OpenJS Foundation Voting Members
* OpenJS Foundation Regular Members
* OpenJS Foundation Board of Directors
* OpenJS Foundation Project Maintainers

## Team Meetings

The Team meets weekly on Zoom.us. A designated moderator
approved by the Team runs the meeting. Each meeting should be
published to YouTube.

Items are added to the Team agenda that are considered contentious or
are modifications of governance, contribution policy, Team membership,
or release process.

The intention of the agenda is not to approve or review all patches;
that should happen continuously on GitHub and be handled by the larger
group of Collaborators.

Any community member or contributor can ask that something be added to
the next meeting's agenda by logging a GitHub Issue. Any Collaborator,
Team member or the moderator can add the item to the agenda by adding
the ***cross-project-council-agenda*** tag to the issue.

Prior to each Team meeting the moderator will share the agenda with
members of the Team. Team members can add any items they like to the
agenda at the beginning of each meeting. The moderator and the Team
cannot veto or remove items.

The moderator is responsible for summarizing the discussion of each
agenda item and sends it as a pull request after the meeting.

## Consensus Seeking Process

The Team follows a
[Consensus Seeking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making)
decision-making model.

When an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus, the moderator
will ask "Does anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the
consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus, a Team member can call for
the item to be decided by a vote or to table the issue to the next
meeting. In both cases the decision must be seconded by a majority of the Team
or else the discussion will continue. Simple majority wins. Only Active
Members participate in a vote.


## Election process for Non-Impact Voting CPC members

As per the [CPC charter](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/master/CPC-CHARTER.md), the non-impact projects elect 2 voting CPC members:

> up to two Voting members may be nominated by the non Impact projects
  based on a process set by the CPC.

These members will be elected as follows:

* Once a year an issue will be opened in the CPC repo announcing that the period for
  nominations is open.

* Any member from one of the non-impact projects can self-nominate by posting a
  reply which includes the following:

  * Projects they are part of
  * Description of their background
  * The reasons they would like to act as the non-impact CPC voting member
  * Confirmation that they can devote the required time/effort.
  * Their employer  (if applicable).  This is needed due to the limitations
    on maximum employer representation in the CPC voting members.

* The nomination period will be open for 2 weeks at which point the issue will be locked.

* Once the nomination period closes, the projects will be asked to confirm membership
  as identified by the nominees.

* Each non-impact project will nominate two `voters` through a process of their choosing.

* Each voter will be able to vote for as many or as few candidates as they wish.

* Those candidates who receive the greatest number of votes will be confirmed as
  the winners. In the case of a tie between 2 or more candidates, there will be coin
  tosses between those candidates in order to select the winner.
